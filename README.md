# April-Tag-VR-FullBody-Tracker
Full-body tracking in VR using AprilTag markers.

This is my second attemt at creating a full-body tracking system using fiducial markers. This version uses the much more accurate AprilTag system, and includes
many improvements to make the system easier to use.

This program allows you to get working full-body tracking in SteamVR using some printed markers, some cardboard, and either a USB camera or a phone.

The program can be downloaded from the releases tab.

## Connecting a camera

The first step is connecting a camera feed to you computer. This step is probably the most complex, since you will have to find out what works best for you.
Each of the methods has its pros and cons, so try them out and see what works best. If you know of any other option, feel free to use that!

### Using a USB webcam:

#### Pros:
* Simple to setup
* High quality cameras will offer good performance(1080p 60fps)

#### Cons:
* Most cameras have a too low resolution and too much motion blur to use effectively

If you have a USB camera, you should try that first. If tracking is too bad, you can always switch to a phone later. A ps3 eye camera will work, but just barely due to its low resolution.

#### Tutorial:

Connect the camera to your PC and you are done! If you use a PS3 eye camera, also install the PS3 eye universal driver.

### Using IP-Webcam wireless:

#### Pros:
* Fairly simple to setup
* Plenty of video options

#### Cons:
* Requires a good wifi connection
* Your PC and phone must be connected to the same network
* Only for android phones

If you have your PC and android phone connected to the same router and you have a strong wifi connection on your phone, this is the option you should use.

#### Tutorial:

Download the app IP Webcam from the play store. Start the app. Under video preferences->video resolution, select the resolution you wish to use. You should try to use a 4:3 aspect ratio with a resolution of around 800x600. Then, go back and click start server. Try to connect to your phone through your browser: click the help icon 
if you dont know how

### Using IP-Webcam wired:

#### Pros:
* Plenty of video options

#### Cons:
* A little harder to setup
* May not work on all phones and computers

If you dont have a good wifi connection, but have a half recent android phone, you should try this option. It may not work, however.

#### Tutorial:

For this we will use our phones network over USB feature. This is usualy used to share the phones network or wifi with a computer, but if we disable wifi and mobile network on our phone, we can also use it as a direct connection between our phone and PC. First disable wifi and mobile network. Then connect your phone to your PC with a USB cable. Now enable the internet over USB option on your phone. Now, you can follow the same instructions as for the wireless one!

NOTE: Make sure that your networks are disabled or this won't work!

### Using DroidCam OBS:

#### Pros:
* Should work on any device, including iphones
* Wired or wireless

#### Cons:
* Less video options than IP-Webcam
* Higher latency

If previous options dont work for you or you have an iphone, this is the option you should choose. It should work on any device, either wireless or wired.

#### Tutorial:

First, follow the DroidCam OBS official tutorial to get the phone-OBS connection. Use the 720p video resolution to ensure there is no watermark.
Then, follow the OBS VirtualCam plugin tutorial to stream to a virtual camera.
The phone will now act as a regular webcam.

## The trackers

### How the trackers work

This is a single Apriltag marker. Each marker has a white square in the middle that is used for detection and an unique pattern of black and white for identification. This means that a single marker must always be completely visible and completely flat in order to be detected.

A tracker is composed of multiple markers facing diffrent directions, which ensures that at least one marker is visible when rotating it. They must all be fixed together and none of the markers that are included in a tracker should move or bend seperately. Tracker 0 is composed of marker id 0 and any number of extra markers of ids 1-44, tracker 1 is marker id 45 and any number of markers 46-89 etc.

The simplest version of three trackers is the following: Tracker 0 made of marker 0 and 1, tracker 1 of marker 45 and 46 and tracker 3 of marker 90 and 91. To prevent bending, they are glued to cardboard. Each of them are glued together at an 90Â° angle. To make them yourselves, print the Apriltag.pdf file. Refer to the below photos to cut them out and glue them properly.

Tracker 0 will be used on our hips, and should use some additional supports. I used some wire, but you can rather just use more cardboard.

Add some way of fixing the trackers to your body. I use some hooks, through which i can then fix the trackers using rubber bands.

NOTE: Make sure the pattern on the trackers is clearly visible and is not obstructed! Ensure the markers bend as little as possible!

## Installing the SteamVR driver

Inside the driver_files folder, there is a apriltagtrackers folder. Copy this folder to "Steam/steamapps/common/SteamVR/drivers". Now, open "Steam/config/steamvr.vrsettings" and, under "steamvr", add the field ```"activateMultipleDrivers" : true,``` .

This will ensure that every time we launch steamvr, it will attempt to connect to the ApriltagTrackers program through our driver.

## Running Apriltag Trackers

You can now run Start_ApriltagTrackers.bat! The first time you launch it, you may see a black console window for a few seconds. Below is a quick guide on what the buttons and parameters do.

### Camera tab

This is the main tab of the program that you will use most of the time.

#### Start/Stop camera

Start the camera or stop it if its already running. This button will open the camera that you have written in the parameters tab. To ensure its working correctly, enable the Show preview checkbox.

If the camera fails to start, ensure that your camera is conencted and running, that you have written the correct id/address, and that you have saved the parameters after changing them. If you are using an USB webcam or OBS, try a diffrent id.

If the camera is of incorrect resolution/shrunk, refer to the camera width and height parameters.

#### Calibrate camera

This will start the camera calibration sequence. Turn off camera preview before starting. This must only be done the first time you use this program and if you change the camera you are using.

Two windows will open: one with a chessboard pattern, and one showing your camera feed. Every few seconds, the camera will take a picture. Move the camera around slowly, taking pictures of the chessboard pattern from as many diffrent angles as possible. Once 15 pictures are taken (progress is written on top left) the camera will calibrate.

Sometimes, if the picture is too blurry or the lightning is bad, the chessboard pattern wont be detected. In that case, change the angle slightly for the next picture until it works. If the pattern is detected very rarely, you can always print the pattern out and calibrate on that, or even use an actual chessboard.

#### Calibrate trackers

This will start tracker calibration. Camera should be running and calibrated. Before starting, put on your trackers in the same way you will use them in game. You must only do this step on first launch and whenever you change the trackers.

Capture the trackers with the camera. To add a marker to the tracker, film it while another, already added marker is seen. A green marker means its already added, yellow means it is being added, and red means it cannot add it because no already added marker is seen. Repeat this process until all markers on the trackers are green.

If some of the markers only have a thin green outline, it means the markers are detected, but do not belong to any of the used trackers. You have probably set a too low number of trackers in the parameters.

#### Connect to SteamVR

When you press this button, the program will start waiting for steamVR to start. Start it from steam. If the connection will succeed, you will se the trackers on the status window, next to the hmd and controllers. After this step, put on your hmd and do the rest from VR.

If the trackers do not show up on the status window, check if you installed the driver correctly. Make sure you copied the folder into the correct place and that you have put EnableMultipleDrivers into the steamvr.config file.

#### Start

This button should be pressed from the virtual desktop in the SteamVR dashboard (dont use oculus/WMR dashboard or you wont see the trackers!). It will start the program, and it will automatically be in calibration mode.

When in calibration mode, a tracker should appear in the center of your playspace, one meter from the ground. Align your calibration tracker (tracker 0 by default) with the seen controller. Then rotate it until your leg trackers will align correctly as well. Once the trackers are aligned, turn of the calibration mode with the check mark. The trackers should now be calibrated! If there is still an offset between the trackers in VR and real life, you can always check the calibration mode again and retry.

If you cant see the trackers: First make sure that you have your SteamVR dashboard open. The trackers dont appear in games or SteamVR home. Second, sometimes, the tracker will not apear at the center of your playspace. Look around. If the tracker is somewhere else, refer to the calibration offset parameters.

### Parameters

#### Ip or ID of camera:

If you have a webcam or OBS, this value will be a number, usualy 0, 1, or more if you have more cameras connected. Best way to figure out the correct index of the camera is to try them: Type in 0, press save, go back to Camera tab, check preview camera and press Start/Stop camera. If the correct camera shows up, great, you can go to the next step! If not, repeat the process with 1, then 2 etc until you find it.

If you use IP Webcam, you should enter your IP address, the same one as you used in your browser but ending with /video. The field should look something like this: ```http://192.168.1.100:8080/video``` but with some diffrent numbers.

#### Number of trackers:

The number of trackers you wish to use. For full body, you have to use 3.

#### Size of markers in cm:

Measure the size of your printed markers in cm, and input the value here. Measure the white square, like this:

#### Rotate camera 90Â°:

This will flip the camera view 90Â°. This will enable you to stand closer to the camera, which is usefull if you dont have much space or you have a low resolution camera (640x480). If you use a PS eye, you should use this.

#### Quad decimate:

This is the quality setting. The value can either be 1, 1.5, 2, 3 or 4. The higher is this value, the faster will the tracking be, but the range will decrease. It is dependant on the camera you use. In general, you will probably have to use 1 on 480p, 2 on 720p and 3 on 1080p. You can fine tune this parameter later based on the performance you are getting. (If you get high FPS, you can decrease it. If your trackers dont get detected well, increase it.)

#### Number of values for smoothing:

The algorithm uses a sliding window mean smoothing. This is the number of previous position values that will be used for the window. It ensures that tracking outliers are removed, but introduces some delay. 5 seems to be the best balance between delay and performance.

If you dont know what that means, just leave it at 5.

#### Additional smoothing:

While the sliding mean does some smoothing, it is usualy not enough to eliminate shaking. Aditional smoothing is done using a leaky integrator, with the formula: current_position = previous_position * value + tracked_position * (1-value).

What this means is that the parameter is between 0 and 1, 0 meaning only using tracking data without smoothing and 1 meaning using only previous data. Decreasing this parameter will increase the speed, but also

### Calibrating the camera

First, start the camera and disable the preview. Now press the Calibrate camera button. This will open two windows, one with a chessboard pattern, the other with the view from the camera. The camera will take a picture every few seconds. Try to film the chessboard pattern from as many angles as you can by slowly moving the camera around. When enough pictures are taken, you should get an alert that the camera has been calibrated.
