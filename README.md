# April-Tag-VR-FullBody-Tracker
Full-body tracking in VR using AprilTag markers.

This is my second attemt at creating a full-body tracking system using fiducial markers. This version uses the much more accurate AprilTag system, and includes
many improvements to make the system easier to use.

This program allows you to get working full-body tracking in SteamVR using some printed markers, some cardboard, and either a USB camera or a phone.

## Connecting a camera

The first step is connecting a camera feed to you computer. This step is probably the most complex, since you will have to find out what works best for you.
Each of the methods has its pros and cons, so try them out and see what works best.

### Using a USB webcam:

#### Pros:
* Simple to setup
* High quality cameras will offer good performance(1080p 60fps)

#### Cons:
* Most cameras have a too low resolution and too much motion blur to use effectively

If you have a USB camera, you should try that first. If tracking is too bad, you can always switch to a phone later. A ps3 eye camera will work, but just barely due to its low resolution.

### Using IP-Webcam wireless:

#### Pros:
* Fairly simple to setup
* Plenty of video options

#### Cons:
* Requires a good wifi connection
* Your PC and phone must be connected to the same network
* Only for android phones

If you have your pc and android phone connected to the same router and you have a strong wifi connection on your phone, this is the option you should use.

### Using IP-Webcam wired:

#### Pros:
* Plenty of video options

#### Cons:
* A little harder to setup
* May not work on all phones and computers

If you dont have a good wifi connection, but have a half recent android phone, you should try this option. It may not work, however.

### Using DroidCam OBS:

#### Pros:
* Should work on any device, including iphones
* Wired or wireless

#### Cons:
* Less video options than IP-Webcam
* Higher latency

If previous options dont work for you or you have an iphone, this is the option you should choose. It should work on any device, either wireless or wired.
