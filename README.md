# April-Tag-VR-FullBody-Tracker
Full-body tracking in VR using AprilTag markers.

This is my second attemt at creating a full-body tracking system using fiducial markers. This version uses the much more accurate AprilTag system, and includes
many improvements to make the system easier to use.

This program allows you to get working full-body tracking in SteamVR using some printed markers, some cardboard, and either a USB camera or a phone.

## Connecting a camera

The first step is connecting a camera feed to you computer. This step is probably the most complex, since you will have to find out what works best for you.
Each of the methods has its pros and cons, so try them out and see what works best.

### Using a USB webcam:

#### Pros:
*Simple to setup
*High quality cameras will offer good performance(1080p 60fps)

#### Cons:
*Most cameras have a too low resolution and too much motion blur to use effectively

If you have a USB camera, you should try that first. If tracking is too bad, you can always switch to a phone later. A ps3 eye camera will work, but just barely due to its low resolution.
