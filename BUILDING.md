# Building AprilTag VR FullBody Tracking

## Linux
First, build `AprilTag`! From the `apriltag` directory, run `cmake -B build && cmake --build build`. The build process should fail, but as long as libapriltag.a has been built, then all is good!

Now, you may build this! `cd` back up to the root of the project, and run `cmake -B build && cmake --build build`.

## Windows
Idk... you tell me!!
