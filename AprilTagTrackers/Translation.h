// This typedef hopefully makes it more obvious of the purpose of wxString,
//  and it should only be used for frontend user facing strings.
// On Windows this will be utf-16 and is essentially a typedef for std::wstring,
//  other platforms this is an encoding aware utf-8 string.
// May be useful for windows file paths aswell, although opencv and other
//  libraries don't always support io with widestring paths anyway.
// In general, all unicode string literals should be in the translation yaml files,
//  and not in a source file.
